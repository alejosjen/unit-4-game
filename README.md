# [Crystal Collector](https://alejosjen.github.io/unit-4-game/)
This is a Javascript and jQuery game to assign random values to the crystals. There's a counter to keep track of the totals as the user clicks on each crystal. The game will keep track of the wins and losses and reload new numbers after each round.
